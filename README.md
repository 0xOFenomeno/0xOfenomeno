### Hi there, it's OFENOMENO :ninja:


I'm Ofenomeno, a 22yo :tr: and :fr: cybersecurity enthusiast. I'm particularly interested in offensive cybersecurity topics like pentest, red team and bug bounty. I'm also attracted by some defensive security topics as threat hunting and DFIR. 

You can find me on following platforms:
- [HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/964076)
- [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/ofenomeno)

You can reach me out here:

- Mail: [ofenomen00@protonmail.com](mailto:ofenomen00@protonmail.com)


I also have a personal blog which is dedicated to share some CTFs and THM/ HTB machines' write-ups and articles about various information security topics:
